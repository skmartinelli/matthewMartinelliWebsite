           </h1>   
            <p>
                Matthew Martinelli is an up and coming author, whose daytime job is teaching high school Economics in Southern California. He’s been writing since the early 2000’s.  A New Son Rising was his first full-length novel, but not his first book. Past, Future, Tense, a collection of exciting short stories, was published in July, 2014 and then the second edition was released in February, 2020. These 14 tales tell stories of the supernatural, adventure, and science fiction. They all contain the unique twists and turns that Matthew is so good at crafting.  Also included is the award-winning story, The Showdown, which is the debut of Angel, the master sharpshooter featured in the travelling circus of A New Son Rising.
